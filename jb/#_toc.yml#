Studies suggest that reducing Veteran poverty could address issues disproportionately experienced by Veterans. [Over 37,000 Veterans](https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/HUD_No_19_163) experience homelessness on a given night, and a recent experiment in Canada found that [cash transfers accelerated](https://forsocialchange.org/our-story) transitions out of homelessness. Veterans have a higher rate of [mental illness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4638236/), especially depression, PTSD, and substance abuse disorder, while Finland's UBI experiment [improved mental health](https://twitter.com/TheUBICenter/status/1258064957406511104). Controlling for age and sex, the Veteran suicide rate exceeds the non-Veteran suicide rate by [50 percent](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2019/2019_National_Veteran_Suicide_Prevention_Annual_Report_508.pdf), and a review of cash transfer programs in low- and middle-income countries found [significant suicide reductions](https://mbrg.bsg.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-05/the_role_of_cash_transfers_in_preventing_suicides_in_lmics_1.pdf).

The unique Veteran experience warrants investment in tailored solutions, such as the health and education programs offered by the VA. Cash transfers like universal basic income can also reduce their incidence of poverty and empower them to meet their individual needs. Even modest basic incomes such as a tax-funded $300 per month would halve Veteran poverty and more than halve poverty among children of Veterans, improving poverty-linked outcomes for those who have served.- file: index
